For a few years now i have been a so called 'fzf power user', with how painfully slow and buggy Microsofts latest iteration of File Explorer is on Windows 11 i reached for a little known tool called ([fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)), It is incredibly fast even on NTFS network drives and has allowed me to many times find files that other people thought were lost to the void of 9 layer deep organisational folder structuring.



# Inventor Object Model
![Image showing the inventor object model](/assets/FullObjectModel.png)

Inventor has a interop DLL file which exposes all of the interfaces shown above. It is similar to how Microsoft office COM API's work.
The indended use case is for writing C# tooling that can interface with the library. But with the might of Powershell we can actually just interact with the interop dll with a simple script 

All we have to do is the following 
 - Use `Add-Type` to load the assembly into our contect
 - Call `New-Object` to create an instance of the COM Object
 - Open the given file with the object.
 - Go nuts!

 ```ps
Add-Type -Path ("C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\assembly\GAC_MSIL\Autodesk.Inventor.Interop\v4.0_25.0.0.0__d84147f8b4276564\Autodesk.Inventor.Interop.dll") # Not sure how this path is generated or exported 
$Server = New-Object -ComObject Inventor.ApprenticeServer
$File = $Server.Open("G:\1-Engineering\1-Bowers\CAD System\Production CAD\Air Gauging\Air Snap\87-17-1.ipt")
$Props = $File.PropertySets

$DTP = $Props.Item("Design Tracking Properties") # These are the default IPropeties Associated with Inventor
 ```
