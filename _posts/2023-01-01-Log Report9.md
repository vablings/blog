After a discussion with the Operations Director we determined that the cost associated with the manufacture of coverplates is too high, additionally machine usage is also costly as it doesn't allow us to get other items on the WireEDM machine. I was assigned the task of determining the cost saving possibilities and the manufacture of a fixture (as covered in other reports) (K2) (K9) (B6) (B2)

### Design
The fixture was designed in Autodesk Inventor 2022 using a part based assembly with parametric modelling. During the design of these fixtures i took the time to make sure my CAD skills improved and became better over time. (B4)

During the design process i read and observed a number of technical drawings related to the cover plate to determine the requirements for said design (B1) (S1)

The project management technique of using a gantt chart allows the project to have a fixed deadline meaning goals for both internal and external shareholders can be met within a reasonable timeframe ()

### Time & Cost savings for the 100-125mm Coverplate Fixture
During the current manufacturing of the coverplate fixture we use batch control to issue the order to be produced. Once the profile has been wired it then is loaded on a VMC one by one to drill, counterbore and dimple this is quite inefficient due to the fact that an operator must be tending to a machine for multiple hours in the day and is unable to be anything other than a glorified fanuc robot. An alternative approach would be to use batch loading where these operations can be done for multiple items at the same time increasing the efficiency of the process.

### Lean methods
Lean methods and tools, such as Kaizen, Six Sigma, and the identification of the 8 wastes, have proven to be invaluable in manufacturing and engineering industries. Kaizen, a Japanese term meaning "continuous improvement," encourages incremental changes that lead to enhanced efficiency and productivity. Six Sigma, on the other hand, is a data-driven methodology that aims to reduce process variation and defects through systematic problem-solving. Identifying and addressing the 8 wastes (defects, overproduction, waiting, non-utilized talent, transportation, inventory, motion, and extra-processing) further streamline operations by minimizing inefficiencies and promoting a more sustainable work environment. By incorporating these lean methodologies, manufacturers can continuously refine their processes, improve product quality, and foster a culture of innovation and efficiency.

### Cost breakdown

Based off the time study we can determine that the new process is a significant cost saving over the old process saving an approximately £6970 (S4)

### Time saving breakdown

The previous process was to wire EDM the coverplate profile (22min/1) which also leaves tags that have to be removed and then to drill, counterbore and dimple which was a 2-operation job on the VMC (3.5min/1). The new process is to purchase water jet coverplates with 1mm stock around the profile (£1.38/1) then to mill complete in 1 operation (3min/1). The new fixturing also allows us to chamfer the profile removing the requirement to linish the chamfer on after grinding. Once we improve the surface finish on the profile, we will be able to remove the deburr & dress operation (3min/1 £2.06) which could bring a further £1139.65/year saving. I believe this can be achieved by running the components on the HAAS VF4 apposed the Mikron. This Process change has brought a cost saving of £6970/Year. Process flow and cost break down below. This change has also given us 255 hours more capacity of the wire EDM. (K17) (S9)

The manufacturing detailed was changed in the SAP record using a SAP Change request form. This then allows our SAP administrators to perform the change to the routing and costings meaning we get accurate and updated manufacturing data (S6) (B7)


### Advanced technology HSM
Due to the improvement in the machining technologies using High Speed Machining (HSM herein) can allow a significantly improved manufacturing process for milling as opposed to wiring. Taking advantage of this machine we can make use of the Haas VF4SS which has support for HSM for high feed milling
(B3)
In the context of Industry 4.0, manufacturers can monitor and control their processes in real-time, leading to reduced waste, increased efficiency, and better decision-making. I recommend that we adopt HSM and other advanced technologies to capitalize on the benefits of Industry 4.0 and remain competitive in an increasingly technology-driven global market. Implementing these solutions not only results in significant cost and time savings but also supports sustainability initiatives by minimizing resource consumption and waste generation.
(K4)
Furthermore as a company we have access to advance Bluetooth gauging systems (Industry 4.0) for measuring parts to ensure that performance and tolerance is adequate as we transition into a less mechanically accurate process (Milling vs WEDM) We can measure most tolerance features on the drawing with Vernier callipers 
(K20)
This initiative to reduce waste with advance technology falls inline with the business long term goals of lowering carbon footprint through the relevant ISO footprint. Although it is difficult in a manufacturing environment due to the nature of work there are always a number of improvements sought to reduce wastes allowing an internal decision to optimise environmental efficiency (K23)

Thre are a number of wastes possible during the manufacture of the coverplate fixture

### Corrective Actions 
- Apply 6m's principles to reduce wastes such as 
	- Change the machine used for the operation. EG: Milling vs WireEDM
	- Change the material used for the operation. EG: Waterjet profile vs Steel sheet
	- Change the method use for the operation. EG: Remove the hand finishing process
(S3)


### Manufacturing data
For the manufacturing data collection system SAP HANA is used.
Within the context of manufacturing, SAP helps in tracking work orders, managing bill of materials (BOM), routing operations, and monitoring work centre capacities. This information enables manufacturers to optimize their processes, reduce waste, and improve overall efficiency. In addition, SAP's quality management module ensures adherence to industry standards and regulations while promoting continuous improvement in product quality.
(K16)


### Report Issued
The findings were reported through a monthly report document presented to high management as a collaboration from production engineering along side other projects communicated as part of a monthly report, each of these reports are saved and there are periodic reviews based on these smaller reports (S5) (S8)
