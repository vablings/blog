Manufacturing a new fixture for the cover plate manufacturing process as discussed in other log reports


To begin the manufacture of the fixture cover plate first we need to set up the machine for manufacture. To do this we must establish a clear working area by cleaning down the machine.

The machine we will be working on is a HAAS VF4SS Milling Machine. For this machine we will be working to SDOC-0004 which is the risk assessment for the machine.

While operating this machine it's important to work to the above listed risk assessment and can be found near the machine or on the network drive. While operating the machine in manufacture I will always operate inside of the risk assessment and with careful consideration to the risk management and mitigation strategies in place to avoid injury of myself or others in the workplace. (K11) (B1)

To clean down the machine we follow the company SOP for machine clean down which involves a series of steps (Summarised) (Note: There is not a wash-down procedure for the VF4 and its for a turning centre all the same ideas apply) (K10)
- Wash down the chips from all machine surfaces, T-slots and chip bin using a coolant hose and air line, Ensure the Emergency stop is activated should anyone climb inside of the machine and if the operator cannot see the machine area a lockout tag must be used.
- Replace the chip bin if full or changing material type as to avoid mixing materials for recycling.
- Check all tools what are to be used in the next setup by inspecting the setup sheet and ensure they are of good condition for manufacture. (EG: No chips, cracks or blunt edges)

Once the machine is ready for manufacturing I selected the material for the job. This had already been ordered by me a few months prior after the drawings were finalised and the drawings are located and issued by Production Engineering. These drawings were printed by Nigel Sharpe and he was in control of the final version ensuring that the correct version was given for manufacture. (S8)
- Documents are "approved" by N.Sharp
- No prior obsolete documents have been issued
- Current documents are marked with a revision number and issue date on the sheet 
- All records are digitally stored and readily retrievable as per ISO9001:2015

During the manufacture of the fixture I will be working alongside Richard Riddex who will be issuing me guidance and knowledge of operating the Haas VF4SS over a wide range of topics. We must work professionally together to ensure a quality outcome (B7) (B6).
The usage of quality assurance principles are very important when manufacturing a one off due to the fact that a mistake can be costly in all aspects of the business
During working with Richard Riddex its important to maintain a good working relationship with him to ensure the professional behaviour and a high level of performance (K13)

Using the Bowers QMS and other internal governance standards will ensuring the manufacturing of this one-off will be correct first time some of the tenants of the Bowers QMS are as proposed. (K7)
-   Properly maintain and calibrate the machine regularly to prevent errors and malfunctions.
-   Ensure that the correct parameters are used for each job, taking into account the material and tool being used to avoid scrap.
-   Regularly check the progress of the machining process and make any necessary adjustments to maintain accuracy and quality through tweaking work offsets, tool offsets and G-code.
-   Have a well-organized and clean workspace to reduce the risk of contamination or damage to the workpiece or machine.
-   Implement error-proofing (poka yoke) and inspection systems to detect and prevent defects during the machining process.

During one of the later operations a carbide drill was broken in the job and it was not possible to remove causing great difficulty in the timeline of the project therefore the decision was made to move the position of the hole after consulting with N. Sharp. (B5)

Sustainability and environmental efficiency are important factors that impact manufacturing decisions during the manufacturing of the fixture 
1.  Raw materials: Companies may opt for environmentally-friendly raw materials, such as recycled metals or bio-based plastics, in order to reduce their carbon footprint and waste. (K23)
2.  Energy usage: The use of renewable energy sources, such as wind or solar power, during the manufacturing process can reduce a company's dependence on non-renewable energy sources, thus contributing to environmental efficiency.
3.  Waste reduction: The implementation of waste reduction strategies, such as recycling and composting, can help to minimize the amount of waste generated during the manufacturing process such as recycling.
Overall, environmental efficiency influences the manufacturing of a subplate fixture on a CNC milling machine by guiding companies to make choices that minimize their impact on the environment and promote sustainability.
