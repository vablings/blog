#### Contacting manufactures to find best solution
To begin the process, I first reached out to several laser manufacturers under the guidance of my supervisor at the time (Tom Parry) and began to arrange and schedule meetings and demonstrations to assess the capabilities of the machine, software and supplier.

#### Sending of samples with parts and communicating requirements (K3)
As part of the process of determining what would be the best machine for the job, I sent a number of emails to manufacturers requesting a sample test of parts to be marked. I then liaised with the production manager to send off those samples to the relevant manufacturers. These samples were returned with varying levels of quality and interest and this helped us make an informed decision on what manufacturer to go with.

### Order of laser machine from Coherent 
After narrowing down the shortlist from several companies we chose a few to send samples to for a test marking and issuing drawings and requirements for the drawings. We sent parts to the following companies: Trumpf, Coherent, Rofin Sinfar and Laserlines and found all of the manufactures to be satisfactory in the quality of the mark what they produced on the components we provided of various material. After communicating our further requirements of advanced manufacturing, we determined that a machine with a large marking area, rotary axis and a small footprint would be good and the machine what fit these criteria for the best price was the Coherent CombiLine Varia F20.

![](https://i.imgur.com/yCoyWQH.png)

#### Interim machine arrival and programming
Once we placed the order with coherent they worked on delivering us an interim machine for programming what allowed me to familiarize myself with the software required for creating marking programs from the dxf's 

##### Drawing problem (K1) 
As i started to create programs for the laser machine i quickly realized due to the organised nature of the drawings what already existed this would not be a simple task to undertake and that a great deal of collaborative effort would be needed 
For this I used a Practical Problem Solving (PPS) approach to ensure that my outcome was successful.
The steps are described as follows
- Define the problem 
	- The problem is that a number of drawings either were missing, unavailable or missing the required detail for laser marking making it difficult to create what is required due to a fixed standard being unavailable.
- Measure the delta
	- The delta is that most of the older series drawings for components we wanted to mark could be spotty at best therefore we can create an approximation of around 80% of drawings need to be collected, collaborated and coalesced. 
- Analyse factors what need to be moderated
	- The factors to moderate is that drawings should be collected and any drawing what is not available could be communicated to the design team so they can bring things inline and assist in finding drawings.
- Improve the situation
	- In the interim while the design team is working towards having a series of correct drawings I can make use of previous laser marking files from the old laser marking machine basing off of the available standard for things to be consolidated in parallel. 
- Control the outcome
	- Therefore the outcome is controlled as we have all of the available resources to actually product the correct drawings based on either drawings, updated drawings or old files thus allowing reasonable progress to be made.

#### Fixture design and manufacture for batch processing (K19) (K6)
I then began designing the fixtures to be used on the new machine using the machine model we had been provided from Coherent. The machine model was a full 3D detail what showed everything. I designed the fixture in mind to be an improvement over the previous single item production or rather flow production.  The new fixture is then going to be using a batch style production where items what are not used with the rotary fixture are going to be laid out in a patterned gang configuration so that efficiencies are gained by means of marking multiple components in a patterned array. For the manufacture of the fixture plates they are made from a water jet cut aluminium plate what is extruded plate as a base on some custom rails and then are assembled 





#### Fixture design and manufacture for batch processing (S1) (S4)
To determine the layout and configuration of these fixtures I had to read technical drawings sourced from the drawing register + drawing cabinet to determine if the design would meet process capability requirements for tolerances to be achieved with regards to the accuracy of the laser marking (S8).
For this to be achieved I had to understand a technical drawing of simple components and detail + annotate them appropriately to ensure that standards are achieved

![](https://i.imgur.com/O3N6ifG.png)

Based on the data from the previous machine marking the component XT275S would take approximately 73seconds to be marked on the old HK laser. With a comparable single marking on the new coherent machine is approximately 34 seconds (based on average cycle time over a few components) 
Plotting this with historical usage data of around ~400 a year we can plot this out into a table of time saving of 39 seconds for XT275S alone coming out to a yearly saving of 260min per year this then plotted out to the rest of the range making a best cased approximation saves 3640min for that specific product range (metric only) totalling to a 60 hour yearly saving applying the imperial range makes this 120 working hours saved across imperial and metric.
There are further savings to be realised in other sub optimal processes such as rings but as a base this shows there is clear improvements to be had in flow processing ALONE.

#### Fixture design and manufacture for batch processing (S6)
The fixture was modeled in autodesk Inventor using the tools for creating a 3d model as below. I then produced a series of technical drawings to aid in the manufacturing of these components by our machining deparment. The drawing border contains a number of pieces of technical information 



![](https://i.imgur.com/vTkFWCb.png)




### Actualising cycle time improvements  (S8) 
The purchase of a new machine can decrease the manufacturing cycle time of marking laser components in several ways. First, the new machine may be able to perform the marking process more quickly than the old machine, reducing the time required for each individual component. Additionally, the new machine may be able to mark multiple components at the same time, reducing the overall time required to mark a batch of components. Furthermore, the new machine may have features such as automatic loading and unloading, which can reduce the time needed for setup and tear-down between production runs. Overall, the use of a new, more efficient machine can help to decrease the manufacturing cycle time and increase the productivity of the marking process.


### Main Combi-line machine arrived 
#### Rolling out production by using a check sheet to ensure mark meets the standard (K15)
As part of management of the integration of the system into full scale production, I made use of a spreadsheet what tracked the status of the programs required for shipping to the final finished package. For this we allocated recommended time for the project and roles and responsibilities were divided for respective departments 

![](https://i.imgur.com/GNiNpCe.png)

A few key things are denoted in the columns. Programs are described by name and part. There are then multiple spreadsheets divided by category 

#### Creating a quality laser mark on various metal surfaces and the science behind them (K7) (K9)  (K16) (K17) (K18) (K23) 
There are several key components to creating a high-quality laser marking on a product. One of the most important factors is the laser itself. The laser must be powerful enough to produce the desired marking, and it must be carefully focused to ensure that the marking is precise and accurate. Additionally, the material being marked must be suitable for laser marking, and it must be properly prepared to ensure that the marking is clear and easy to read. Finally, the marking process must be carefully controlled to ensure that the marking is consistent and of high quality.

For creating a quality mark a few key components are involved 
- Quality parts must be available pre marking
- There must be a present standard or specification for the type of mark, location of the mark per material and its respective coating 

##### Laser engraving/anodising/ablation
Anodising vs Ablation vs Engraving
*Laser Anodising*
>Laser anodizing is a process that involves using a laser to modify the surface of a metal, such as aluminium, to create a protective layer on its surface. This layer, known as an oxide layer, is formed when the metal is subjected to an electric current in a solution, such as water or an electrolyte. The laser is used to precisely control the depth and width of the oxide layer, which can improve the metal's resistance to wear and corrosion. Laser anodizing is often used in the aerospace, automotive, and medical industries, where it can help improve the performance and durability of metal components. 

*Laser anodising*
>Laser anodizing is a process in which a laser is used to alter the surface of a metal object, typically aluminum or titanium. (K18) The laser beam is used to heat the metal surface, causing it to oxidize and form a thin layer of anodic oxide. This layer of oxide is highly resistant to corrosion and wear, making it an attractive option for enhancing the durability and performance of metal parts and components.

*Laser ablation*
>Laser ablation is a process in which a focused laser beam is used to remove material from a surface. The laser beam vaporizes the material, causing it to be "ablated," or removed, from the surface. This process can be used for a variety of purposes, including removing contaminants from a surface, creating precise cuts in materials, or etching patterns or shapes into a surface. Because the laser can be focused to a very small spot, laser ablation can be a highly precise and controlled way of removing material.



#### Machine Training (K2)
For working with machine training there was not a great deal of training provided by Coherent therefore I had to learn the machine and technology myself by applying myself and then be able to communicate to Ross Trip to ensure that he can operate the machine to an acceptable standard.

#### Working to drawings (K5) (K7)
Quality management systems (QMS) are frameworks that organizations use to ensure that they consistently meet customer requirements and deliver high-quality products and services. These systems provide a structured approach for managing and continually improving an organization's processes, products, and services.
ISO 9001 is a standard for a QMS that focuses on the requirements for a company's quality management system. It is applicable to organizations of all sizes and in all sectors and is based on the principle of continuous improvement. The standard outlines the requirements for a QMS, including the need for a documented system, the involvement of top management, and the identification and control of processes.
ISO 14001 is a standard for an environmental management system (EMS). It provides a framework for organizations to manage their environmental responsibilities in a systematic and proactive manner. The standard outlines the requirements for an EMS, including the need for a documented system, the involvement of top management, and the identification and control of processes.

#### Drawings and laser marking systems (K5) (K7)
In working to a drawing for a laser marking machine using these QMS systems, the organization would need to ensure that it is following all of the requirements outlined in the applicable standards. This might include establishing documented procedures for each process, involving top management in the development and implementation of the QMS, and identifying and controlling the processes involved in the production of the laser marking machine. The organization would also need to continually monitor and measure the performance of its processes and make any necessary improvements to ensure that the laser marking machine meets the required quality standards.


#### Advanced machine capabilities. (K4)
Industry 4.0, also known as the Fourth Industrial Revolution, is characterized by the integration of advanced technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning into manufacturing and other industries. These technologies are expected to have a significant impact on organizations, including the integration of digital systems with regard to a laser marking machine.
One way that Industry 4.0 is expected to impact organizations is through the use of connected devices and sensors, which can transmit data in real-time to a central system. This can allow organizations to monitor the performance of their machinery and processes more closely, identify potential issues before they become problems, and make data-driven decisions to improve efficiency.
In the context of a laser marking machine, Industry 4.0 technologies could be used to monitor the performance of the machine in real-time, detect any potential issues, and trigger maintenance or repairs as needed. This can help to reduce downtime and improve the overall reliability and efficiency of the machine.
Additionally, Industry 4.0 technologies can be used to optimize the production process and improve the quality of the final product. For example, machine learning algorithms could be used to analyze production data and identify opportunities for process improvements. This could involve identifying bottlenecks in the production process, optimizing the machine's settings to improve performance, or identifying the root cause of quality issues and implementing corrective actions.
Overall, Industry 4.0 technologies are expected to have a significant impact on organizations by enabling them to monitor and optimize their production processes, improve efficiency and reliability, and increase the quality of their products and services.

#### Batch marking and Kanban system (K19)
Batch marking refers to the process of producing a group of products in a single production run. In batch marking, a group of components are produced at the same time, and each component is marked with the same information. This approach can be used when producing components that are identical or very similar in terms of the marking required.
A Kanban system is a type of inventory management system that is commonly used in manufacturing environments. The word "kanban" means "signboard" or "card" in Japanese, and the system is based on the use of physical or digital cards to signal the need for a production or replenishment of a specific product or component.
In the context of a laser marking machine, a Kanban system could be used to control the production of batches of components that are marked using the machine. For example, when a batch of components is produced, a Kanban card could be created to signal the need for the next batch of components to be produced. This card would be passed along to the appropriate parties as the batch is produced, and it would be used to trigger the production of the next batch when the current batch is completed.
By using a Kanban system, organizations can improve the efficiency of their production processes by ensuring that components are produced in a just-in-time manner, rather than being produced in advance and then stored until they are needed. This can help to reduce inventory costs and improve the overall efficiency of the production process.
In summary, batch marking is a production method in which a group of components are produced at the same time and marked with the same information, and a Kanban system is a type of inventory management system that is used to control the production of batches of components in a just-in-time manner.

#### Explore cycle times saved (K17)
Cycle times are tracked using SAP to keep variance low.
In manufacturing, variance refers to the difference between the actual performance of a process and the desired performance. In the context of cycle times, low variance means that the actual cycle times are consistently close to the desired cycle times. This is important for a number of reasons:
1.  Efficiency: Low variance in cycle times can help to improve the efficiency of a production process by ensuring that the process is running smoothly and consistently. This can help to reduce waste and increase productivity.
2.  Quality: Low variance in cycle times can also help to improve the quality of the final product. If cycle times vary significantly, it can lead to variations in the quality of the product, as the process may not be consistently producing components that meet the required specifications.
3.  Cost: Low variance in cycle times can help to reduce costs by minimizing waste and reducing the need for rework or repairs. This can help to increase profitability and competitiveness.
4.  Customer satisfaction: Finall, low variance in cycle times can help to improve customer satisfaction by ensuring that orders are delivered on time and that the quality of the products meets the customer's expectations.
Overall, it is important for organizations to track and manage variance in order to improve the efficiency, quality, and profitability of their production processes, and to ensure that they are meeting the needs of their customers.



#### Machine sign off + Cost review (K21)


![](https://i.imgur.com/LGFT2Cc.jpg)

Above is the purchase requisition raised for the Coherent Laser machine, This was liaised through with the directory Tom Parry after the decision on what laser machine to purchase was made
